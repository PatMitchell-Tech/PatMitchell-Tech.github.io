				<p class="intro">
					Hi my name is Patrick Mitchell. I have an interest in server infrastructure, networking infrastructure, and technology as a whole. I love working within collabrative environments to help solve technical problems and assist end users with technology. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Throughout my experience as a student at Lake Superior College I have learned many different aspects of network administration, network security, and system administration. For my internship I worked as a Gencyber camp counselor. As a camp counselor I lead a team of 5 middle school to high school aged students. I helped assist them with technical problems such as installing windows and linux based vms. We also did a CTF hacking competition, Cybersecurity themed scavenger hunt, as well as phishing simulations.

									I grew up in redwing and then moved to the twin cities. I eventually moved to duluth to go to Lake Superior College. I first got interested in technology when I was really young playing on my dad's playstation one, setting it up and connecting it to our crt monitor. I eventually got interested in taking apart consoles and learning more about computers through my teen years. I have always been someone who likes solving problems and helping people which is what lead me to the field i'm in.
