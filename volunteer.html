	  			   I have done contract volunteer work for Lake Superior College by working as a camp counselor in the NSA funded GenCyber program. I have also helped many family and friends with IT related issues such as reimaging computers, upgrading pc parts, as well as software updates, installation, and removal.

									<p>	Work Performed:
										<br>
										I co-managed 9 VR headsets with a fellow camp counselor, imaged computers, setup a pihole server on a raspberry pi, collabrated with fellow camp counselors to support over 40 students with pc troubles or questions, performed documentation on VR headsets and arduino labs, formatted and imaged multiple micro sd cards for raspberry pis. I led a group of 5 students through a cybersecurity scavenger hunt, CTF competition, arduino setup and programming, as well as python programming, and creating mobile apps using thunkable. I also educated my five students on cybersecurity best practices to help ensure that they will be better equipped to support and defend end users and themselves from bad security practices.

										<br>
										I have helped many people through my volunteer work. In gencyber I have helped many students with computer and software related problems. I have also learned how to support many different types of end users with varying technical backgrounds.
										I helped walkthrough and support many different students installing different operating systems such as ubuntu, and linux mint.
