	  			   I have done volunteer work for Lake Superior College by working as a camp counselor in the NSA funded GenCyber program. I have also helped many family and friends with IT related issues such as reimaging computers, upgrading pc parts, as well as software updates, installation, and removal.

									<p>
										I helped students through the process of installing ubuntu 24.04 lts desktop onto virtual machines. Throughout the process of this I helped them reinstall corrupted operating systems and walked them through the installation process if they got stuck. I also did research to help support the students dealing with more complex issues that simple fixes wouldn't help.
										For when it comes to family and friends I have removed a few viruses from their desktop which involved writing over their hard drives using the Tronscript and then reimaging their computers. I have also reimaged a family members computers after they accidently formatted their boot drive.

										I have helped many people through my volunteer work. In gencyber I have helped many students with computer and software related problems. I have also learned how to support many different types of end users with varying technical backgrounds.
										I helped walkthrough and support many different students installing different operating systems such as ubuntu, and linux mint.
