					Most of the volunteer work I have done has been simple IT related tasks for family, and family friends. My volunteer work has taught me how to support end users. This also taught me the importance of displaying empathy while solving problems for users.

									I have helped educate family and friends on what phishing looks like and clearing out phishing emails from countless peoples phones and computers. I have done computer reimaging for computers with corrupted operating systems.
									I have removed chrome redirect adware from computers. I have updated operating systems, software, and device drivers. I have used wiztree to analyze diskspace on end users computers to find large unused programs to clear out diskspace.
									I have also reset countless passwords for office 365 and google accounts. I have also helped family and friends with countless network issues such as not being able to access websites or the internet.

									<p>
										Throughout my volunteer work I have helped countless people with software, network, and hardware related issues. I have prevented many of my family members from clicking malicious links from scammers. I have also helped a family member reimage their computer after they deleted system32 from their computer.
										I have taught many of my family and friends the importance of network security and educated them to help them become more self reliant with technology. Another thing my volunteer work has taught is how to talk to a variety of end users all with differing technical backgrounds. This vastly improved my communication skills and troubleshooting skills.
